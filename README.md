Kramax Autopilot
----------------
Recently I started flying spaceplanes in Kerbal and discovered I could never land them successfully. My keyboard flying skills are sub-par. This despite being an instrumented rated pilot of real planes. 

Attributions
------------
This plugin is a heavily modified version of "Pilot Assistant" by Crzyrndm (<https://github.com/Crzyrndm/Pilot-Assistant>). At least half (if not more) of the code is his. Many thanks as to him, as this would never have been possible without it.
In addition, I drew heavily on algorithms for calculating great circle routes from <http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html>. Many thanks for that information.
